Ans:


## 7.2 Start a Kafka service. Keep the window open. What is the command? What directory must you be in to run this command as provided? Why?

Ans: To Start a Kafka Service use this command from anywhere on your laptop. 
##### Command: .\bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat .\config\server.properties
If KAFKA_HOME path is not added in your environment variables then one must start KAFKA through this folder: for example in my PC  
##### Directory:  C:\44517\kafka_2.12-2.4.1 folder
Once you add KAFKA_HOME path to the environment variables then kafka can be accessed from anywhere on the laptop.
Basic use of Environment variables is to help programs know what directory to install files in, where to store temporary files, and where to find user profile settings for that particular software.
